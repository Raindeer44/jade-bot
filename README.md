# Jade Bot

Jade-bot is a Node.js Twitter bot which automates the process of Twittering for [@jmthorntonwhat](https://twitter.com/jmthorntonwhat). It basically favorites and retweets for me, among other small tasks.

This doesn't mean there's never a Human behind my Twitter account, just some of my account.

This Jade bot was created with the help of [Spences10](https://github.com/spences10)'s Node.js [Twitter bot bootstrap](https://github.com/spences10/twitter-bot-bootstrap), and with inspiration from [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself).
